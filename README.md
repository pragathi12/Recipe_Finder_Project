# Recipe_Finder_Project
Developed a full-stack MERN application for managing a recipe database with features to initialize the database, 
search recipes by name, ingredients, or description, and display results in a responsive card layout. Built the 
backend with Node.js and Express for data handling using MongoDB, and created a dynamic React frontend with 
controlled forms, recipe cards, and detailed views. Implemented an add-recipe feature with ingredient auto suggestions and a favorites system for managing and viewing favorite recipes. Deployed the application on AWS 
EC2 for live access
